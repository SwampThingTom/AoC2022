### Programming Language 

[Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)) was created in 2004 by Martin Odersky at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland.
It's a functional programming language built on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Because of that, it can be run anywhere Java can be run, including Android devices.

### Why I Chose It

Honestly, this is one of the languages I've used the least and one of the riskier ones I chose.
While going through Academy at Appian (our new-hire orientation), we were learning Appian's proprietary language, SAIL.
Since SAIL is a functional language, several of us new engineers compared it to functional languages we knew.
A few mentioned Scala and I was intrigued by their description of a functional language that ran on a JVM.

I spent a few months afterwards playing around with it.
I was intrigued but didn't do anything with it after that.

### How It Went

I spent way too much time on this one.
Partly due to inexperience with Scala but I also struggled with how to maintain state for my breadth-first-search.
I ended up giving up on the day of the puzzle and came back to it after Christmas.

I like Scala's pattern matching and elegent list handling.
But I think I'd have to spend a lot of time programming in Scala to really start thinking in Scala.

### Tools

[Scala 3](https://www.scala-lang.org/)

### Running

To automatically fetch your input file and run the program, enter:

```
make run
```
