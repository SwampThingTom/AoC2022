# Advent of Code 2022

I'm completing these puzzles using a different programming language every day.
I chose the languages from ones I've used either professionally or on side projects over the past 40 years that I've been programming.
I'm doing them in roughly the order in which I learned them.

The years after each language are approximately when I was actively using it.

Day 1: BASIC (1978-1985)\
Day 2: 6502 Assembly (1982-1986)\
Day 3: Pascal (1984-1989)\
Day 4: C (1986-2005+)\
Day 5: Lisp (1987-1990)\
Day 6: Smalltalk (1988)
