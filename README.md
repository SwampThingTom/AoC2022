# Advent of Code 2022

I'm completing these puzzles using a different programming language every day.
I chose the languages from ones I've used either professionally or on side projects over the past 40 years that I've been programming.
I'm doing them in roughly the order in which I learned them.

The years after each language are approximately when I was actively using it.

[Day 1](01-CalorieCounting): BASIC (1978-1985)\
[Day 2](02-RockPaperScissors): 6502 Assembly (1982-1986)\
[Day 3](03-RucksackReorg): Pascal (1984-1989)\
[Day 4](04-CampCleanup): C (1986-2005+)\

## Running

To run these, you'll need to download your input files.
These should be saved in a file named `input.txt` in the same directory as the puzzle solution.

Each day's folder has a makefile that attempts to download that day's input for you.
In order for this to work, you have to have a file named `.aoc-session` in your home directory.
That file should contain the value of the session cookie used by AoC to authenticate you.
See [this](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1) for a quick explanation of how to get the session cookie for your account.
