### Programming Language 

[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++) was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985.
His goal was to add classes to the popular C programming language.
It remains one of the most popular programming languages and continues to evolve.
New versions of the standard are released every three years.

### Why I Chose It

C++ was the first object-oriented programming language that I used a lot.
I was introduced to it my senior year of college, around 1990.
It wasn't until the late 1990s that I started using it professionally.
Between 1998 and 2005, it was my language of choice for both personal and work projects.

I stopped using it around then as I started working on more Java projects.
Around 2020 I had a chance to pick it back up for a work project.
We needed an internationalization library for an iOS app that was backed by icu4c's C++ API.

### How It Went

C++ was a perfect choice for solving today's problem.
Using classes to model the CPU and CRT is probably overkill but it did help encapsulate the logic.
I'm pretty happy with my solution.

### Tools

[Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)

### Running

To automatically fetch your input file and run the program, enter:

```
make run
```
