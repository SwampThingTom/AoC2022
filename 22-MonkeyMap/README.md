### Programming Language 

[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) was designed by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), a mathematics research center in the Netherlands.
It was initially released in 1991.

Python is a dynamically-typed, garbage-collected language with support for both OO and functional programming styles.
It is one of the most popular programming languages and frequently the primary language taught in U.S. high schools and colleges.

### Why I Chose It

I'm a newcomer to Python.
Although it's been around for as long as I've been programming professionally, I had no exposure to it until I joined Appian.
Around 2020 my nephew raved about how much he loved Python and showed me Jupyter Notebooks.
I did a few of the 2020 Advent of Code puzzles in Python, although I mostly used Swift that year.

In 2021, I moved to a new team in Appian that primarily uses Python for a microservice.
So that year I used Python for all of the Advent of Code puzzles.

Having been using it professionally for more than a year now, I have overcome most of my skepticism of its odd, and to me klumsy, syntax.
It's pretty easy to write good software quickly in Python.

That said, there are still a few things that keep it from being one of my preferred languages.
The first is the klunky module / import system.
The second is that the OO syntax could use a couple of heaping tablespoons of syntactic sugar.
Finally, I'm just not a fan of indentation-based scoping.

### How It Went
