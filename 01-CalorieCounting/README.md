### Programming Language 

[BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was created by John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz at Dartmouth College in 1964.
They wanted to make it easier for students in non-scientific fields to program computers.
It became the de facto programming language for the original home computers of the 1970s and 80s.

### Why I Chose It

It was my first programming language.
I taught myself how to program using it in 5th grade thanks to books and magazines like Creative Computing.
One of my first programs automated creating Dungeons and Dragons characters.
I also played around with making simple video games on the Atari 800, Commodore 64, and Apple II.

Dijkstra believed that [BASIC was a terrible first language to learn](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/79997-it-is-practically-impossible-to-teach-good-programming-to-students#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20is%20practically%20impossible%20to%20teach%20good%20programming%20to%20students,mutilated%20beyond%20hope%20of%20regeneration.%E2%80%9D).
But it served me well.

### How It Went

Fortunately today's puzzle was very straightforward.
It just required reading a file containing lists of integers separated by blank lines, summing each list, and finding the largest three sums.
BASIC was a good fit.

I certainly wouldn't reach for BASIC as my first tool for most programming projects but it was fun to revisit.
